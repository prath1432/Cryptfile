CRYPTFILE: File Encryption and Decryption Utility

CRYPTFILE is a secure and user-friendly utility for encrypting and decrypting files using robust cryptographic algorithms such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and DES (Data Encryption Standard). The tool offers flexible decryption options via password or secret key, ensuring data confidentiality and accessibility. It automatically generates encrypted files alongside a secret key and keeps a comprehensive log of all operations for security auditing.

Key Features:

1. File Encryption and Decryption:

Supports encryption and decryption of various file types, including documents and images.

Provides flexibility by allowing decryption with either a secret key or password.

2. Automatic Folder Creation:

Each encryption creates a folder containing the encrypted file and a human-readable secret key for easy decryption.

3. Encryption Algorithms:

AES: Provides strong encryption with key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits.

DES: Offers basic encryption with a 56-bit key for simplicity and compatibility.

4. Decryption Options:

Password: Users can set a password for additional security.

Secret Key: Allows decryption using a generated secret key stored securely in the folder.

5. Log File Generation:

Logs all encryption and decryption operations, including file names, algorithms used, and timestamps, for complete traceability.

Example Use Cases:

1. Encrypting a DOCX File Using AES:

Encryption: A DOCX file is encrypted with AES using the password "PasswoRd123," and a folder is created containing the encrypted file and secret key.

Decryption: The file is decrypted using the secret key, and the original DOCX file is restored.

Log Entry: Detailed log includes file name, algorithm used, and timestamps.

2. Encrypting a JPG File Using DES:

Encryption: A JPG file is encrypted with DES using the password "qwerty," with a folder created containing the encrypted file and secret key.

Decryption: The file is decrypted using the Password "qwerty", and the original image is restored.

Log Entry: Logs include file name, algorithm used, and timestamps.

3. Log File Summary:

A complete log of operations, including timestamps, file types, encryption algorithms, and decryption methods, ensures easy auditing and traceability of all encryption activities
